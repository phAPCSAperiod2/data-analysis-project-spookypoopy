# AP CSA Mini‑Project: Data Analysis with Arrays & File Input
### Using CSV Files • Arrays of Objects • Algorithms • Data Ethics & Quality

---

## 📌 Project Overview
In this mini‑project, you will choose a dataset (CSV file), design a **custom class** to represent each row, read the dataset using the **Scanner** class, store all data as **objects** in an ArrayList or array, and answer a **guiding question** by analyzing the data.

This project reinforces:

- Arrays & ArrayLists  
- File input with `Scanner`  
- Class design (attributes, constructors, methods)  
- Algorithms (min, max, average, filtering)  
- Data quality & ethics  
- Documentation using **Javadoc**  
- Creating a **UML class diagram**  

By the end, you will produce insights and answer your original question using your program.

---

## 🎯 Your Task
You will:

1. **Choose a dataset** (teacher provided or public).  
2. **Write a guiding question** for your dataset.  
3. **Design a Java class** with ≥ 3 attributes.  
4. **Use `Scanner` to read a CSV file**, parse rows, and construct objects.  
5. **Store all objects** in an array or ArrayList.  
6. **Analyze the dataset** using algorithms you create.  
7. **Print insights** and answer your guiding question.  
8. **Document your code** with Javadoc.  
9. **Create a UML class diagram** representing your custom class.  

Optional stretch challenges are included at the bottom!

---

## 🧪 Example Questions You Might Ask
Your dataset might allow you to answer things like:

- *"Which Pokémon type has the highest average Attack?"*  
- *"Which U.S. state had the lowest obesity rate in 2020?"*  
- *"What country had the highest CO₂ emissions in 2000?"*  
- *"What is the average HP for Fire-type Pokémon?"*  

Think simple, clear, and answerable.

## 📁 Project Structure
Your repository should follow this structure:
```
/src
    Main.java
    YourClass.java
/data
    your_dataset.csv
README.md   ← this file
UML_Diagram.png (or UML_Diagram.pdf)
```

---

## 🧩 Step 1 — Choose Your Dataset

**Dataset Name:**  
**Source / Link:**  

**What this dataset contains (2–3 sentences):**  
____________________________________________________________________  
____________________________________________________________________  

---

## ❓ Step 2 — Write Your Guiding Question

Your guiding question should be something you can answer using your dataset.

**My guiding question:**  
____________________________________________________________________  
____________________________________________________________________  

Examples:

- "Which Pokémon has the highest HP?"  
- "What is the average life expectancy in this dataset?"  
- "Which state had the highest vaccination rate?"  

---

## 🧱 Step 3 — Design Your Class

You must create a class that represents **one row** of your dataset.

### ✔ Your class must include:

- **At least 3 private attributes**  
- **A constructor** that takes all attributes as parameters  
- **Getter methods** for attributes you plan to analyze  
- **`toString()`** for easy printing  
- Any additional analysis/helper methods as needed  

### ✏ Include your class diagram


---

## 📥 Step 4 — Read Your CSV File Using Scanner

In `Main.java`, you must:

- Create a `File` object  
- Use `Scanner` to read the file  
- Skip the header row (if needed)  
- Read each line  
- Split by commas using `.split(",")`  
- Trim whitespace  
- Parse numbers using `Integer.parseInt()` or `Double.parseDouble()`  
- Construct objects  
- Add them to an ArrayList or array  

### Column → Attribute Map

| Attribute Name | CSV Column Name | Column Index # | Notes |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------|
|                |                  |                |       |
|                |                  |                |       |
|                |                  |                |       |

---

## 📊 Step 5 — Analyze Your Data

You must write **at least two algorithms** to analyze your dataset.

### Required: Choose 2 or more algorithms
- [ ] Minimum value of attribute  
- [ ] Maximum value of attribute  
- [ ] Average of attribute  
- [ ] Filter by category  
- [ ] Count items matching a condition  

**Algorithms I will implement:**

1. __________________________________________  
2. __________________________________________  

Optional extras:  
- Sorting  
- Top/bottom N items  
- Grouping by category  
- Comparison between groups  

---

## 🧠 Step 6 — Insights & Answer to Your Question

After analyzing your objects, print:

- ✔ How many rows were loaded  
- ✔ Your algorithm results  
- ✔ A clear answer to your guiding question  

**My findings:**  
____________________________________________________________________  
____________________________________________________________________  
____________________________________________________________________  

**My answer to the guiding question:**  
____________________________________________________________________  
____________________________________________________________________  

---

## 📝 Step 7 — Documentation Requirements

### ✔ Javadoc Comments
You MUST use Javadoc for:

- Every **class**  
- Every **method**  
- Every **parameter**  
- Every **return value**  

Example:
```java
/**
 * Returns the highest HP among all Pokémon.
 * @param list the ArrayList of Pokémon objects
 * @return highest HP value in the dataset
 */
public static int findMaxHP(ArrayList<Pokemon> list) {
    // implementation
}
```

### ✔ UML Class Diagram
Add a UML diagram showing:

- Class name
- Attributes
- Methods
- Visibility (private/public)

Save as `UML_Diagram.png` or `.pdf` in the repo.

---

## 🛡 Step 8 — Data Ethics & Quality Reflection
Write a short reflection (3–5 sentences):

- What data-quality issues did you find?
- Could your dataset be biased?
- How might incomplete or inaccurate data affect results?
- How trustworthy are your insights?

**My reflection:**  
____________________________________________________________________  
____________________________________________________________________  
____________________________________________________________________  
____________________________________________________________________
